Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, CVZone, Hand Tracking, Computer Vision, Gesture Recognition
Project Description:
Developed an interactive hand-tracking application using OpenCV and the CVZone library to implement a drag-and-drop interface.
The project leverages computer vision techniques to detect hand landmarks in real-time, allowing users to manipulate on-screen graphical elements with intuitive gestures. 
The application tracks multiple hands (up to 2) and recognizes finger positions, particularly the index and middle fingers, to detect pinch gestures. 
The system enables users to "drag" multiple on-screen rectangles by detecting if the fingers are inside or close to the defined boundaries of the rectangle, with real-time feedback provided.
